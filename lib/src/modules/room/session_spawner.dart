/// Owns the pending-spawn state machine shared by [ThreadViewState] and
/// [RoomState].
///
/// Encapsulates:
/// - The concurrency guard — [spawn] is a no-op while another spawn is
///   in-flight.
/// - Pending-future tracking and race detection via [cancel].
/// - Cleanup of a spawn future that was abandoned by [cancel].
///
/// The lifecycle [Signal<AgentSessionState?>] is NOT owned by the spawner;
/// callers pass an `onStateTransition` callback and own the signal they
/// update from it. This keeps the spawner scoped to spawn-phase logic and
/// leaves session-level state (running, detached, etc.) to the caller.
///
/// Callback asymmetry: [spawn] notifies `onStateTransition` with
/// `spawning` on entry, and with `null` from its `finally` block on
/// any non-success path (spawn future failed, owner disposed, or
/// `onSpawned` threw). On success the spawner does not emit again —
/// the caller's `onSpawned` is expected to drive the next transition.
/// [cancel] deliberately does NOT call back into `onStateTransition`
/// — callers are responsible for clearing their lifecycle signal when
/// they invoke [cancel]. This asymmetry is intentional: the caller
/// already knows a cancel is happening and may want to bundle other
/// side-effects with the signal clear.
